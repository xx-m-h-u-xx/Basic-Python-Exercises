# Challenge 5 - Floats #

numberOne=float(input("Enter a number between 0 and 10"))
numberTwo=float(input("Enter a number between 0 and 10"))
print(numberOne + numberTwo)

# When entering '5' as both for numberOne and numberTwo it added the two sets of numbers giving an answer '10.0' because its says "Float" - it will give decimal answers #
# Entered '4.5 and 5.5', the program gave me an answer of '10.0'
