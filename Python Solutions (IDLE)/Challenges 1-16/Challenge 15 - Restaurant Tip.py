# Challenge 15 - Restaurant Tip#

        ### Create a Program:...
## Q: Two people eat dinner at a restaurant and want to split the bill.
    # The total comes to £100 and they want to leave a 15% tip. How much should each person pay?
    # Harder: Make the program ask how many people there are, what percentage the tip should be and how much the bill comes to.



print("what percentage do you want the tip to be?")
tip=int(input())
cost= 100 / 100 * tip
cost=cost+100
cost=cost / people
print("Each person must pay £", cost)
