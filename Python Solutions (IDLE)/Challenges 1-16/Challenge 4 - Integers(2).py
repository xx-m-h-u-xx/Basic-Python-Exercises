numberOne=int(input("Enter a number between 0 and 10:"))

# When I enter the number '5' as numberOne and entered '5' again as numberTwo it added them and gave me a total of '10' # 

# When entered '4.'5 as numberOne it then gave me an error this is due to valueError invalid literal for int this is because '4.5' is not an integer #
